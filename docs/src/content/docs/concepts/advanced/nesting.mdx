## Nesting models in directories

Once datagen is adopted across many services, you might want to organize the models in separate directories, one for each service. Consider serviceA having a model for the 3 tables it has; tableA, tableB, tableC. Also, consider there exists another serviceB, which has tables tableA, tableD, tableE

Now, the directory structure can be:

```bash
├── serviceA
│   ├── tableA.dg
│   ├── tableB.dg
│   └── tableC.dg
└── serviceB
    ├── tableA.dg
    ├── tableD.dg
    └── tableE.dg
```

When you wish to refer to `tableB`, you can do so via: `self.datagen.serviceA.tableB().<column>()`.
Similarly, to refer to `tableD`, you can do so via: `self.datagen.serviceB.tableB().<column>()`.

Note, both service A and B have `tableA`, but that is okay since they have to be accessed via the fully qualified path, so there is no confusion as to which model is being referred to.
All the paths are relative to the models input directories.
