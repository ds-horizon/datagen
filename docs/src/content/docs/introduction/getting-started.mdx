Get up and running with datagen in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through installing datagen and generating your first dataset.

## Prerequisites

:::note
Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- **go 1.24.0 or later**
- **git** (for installation from source)
- **make** (for installation from source)
:::

## Installation

### Option 1: Install via Go

Check your `$PATH`, and choose a directory you would like to place the `datagenc` compiler in.

```bash
echo $PATH
/Users/username/go/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin
```

Say, you wish to place the binary in `/opt/homebrew/bin`;

```bash
export GOBIN=/opt/homebrew/bin
go install github.com/ds-horizon/datagen/cmd/datagenc@latest
```

##### Verify installation

```bash
datagenc --help
```

### Option 2: Install from Source

##### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone github.com/ds-horizon/datagen
```

##### Build the compiler

```bash
make build-compiler
```

:::tip
For permanent access on Mac/Unix, add the binary to your path, or add the current directory to your path:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)' >> ~/.bashrc  # for bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)' >> ~/.zshrc   # for zsh
```

For permanent access on Windows, add to your shell profile:

```powershell
echo '$env:PATH += ";C:\path\to\datagen"' >> $PROFILE
```
:::

Now, source the `rc` files or fire up a new terminal window for the changes to take effect.

##### Verify installation

```bash
datagenc --help
```

## Your First Model

Let's create a simple user model to generate some test data.

```go title="users.dg"
model users {
  fields {
    name() string
    age() int
  }

  gens {
    func name() {
      return "Arthur Dent"
    }

    func age() {
      return IntBetween(18, 65)
    }
  }
}
```

## Generate Your First Data

Now let's generate some data from this model:

```bash
datagenc gen users.dg
```

**Output:**
```shell
users{name:Arthur Dent age:42}
```

:::tip[ðŸŽ‰ Success!]
Congratulations! You've successfully generated your first dataset with datagen. 

**Next steps:**
- Learn about [data models](/datagen/concepts/data-model) to understand the core concepts
- Explore more [examples](/datagen/examples/1_fields/fields-overview) to learn about different data generation patterns
- Check out [built-in functions](/datagen/language/built-in-functions) for generating realistic data
