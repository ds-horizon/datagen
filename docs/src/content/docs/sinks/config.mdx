title: Configuration Overview (config.json)
---

The config.json file controls which models to generate and where to load the data.

### Top-level keys
- clear_data (boolean): If true, clears target sink tables/collections before loading
- models (array): Which models to generate and how many records
- sinks (array): Target sink definitions and their connection/configuration

### Structure
```json
{
  "clear_data": true,
  "models": [
    {
      "model_name": "<namespace.model>",
      "target_sinks": ["<sink_name>"],
      "count": 100
    }
  ],
  "sinks": [
    {
      "sink_name": "<sink_name>",
      "sink_type": "mysql",
      "config": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** "namespace.model" refers to the directory structure (namespace) plus the model name, joined with dots. For example, if your file is at models/pluto/users/User.dg and declares `model User { ... }`, the fully-qualified name would be `pluto.users.User`.

### models items
- model_name (string): Fully-qualified model name derived from directory structure + model name (e.g., "pluto.users.User")
- target_sinks (array of strings): Names of sinks to load this model into
- count (number, optional): Overrides the model's metadata count

### sinks items
- sink_name (string): Unique identifier referenced by models
- sink_type (string): Type of sink (currently: "mysql")
- config (object): Sink-specific configuration (see MySQL sink docs)
