title: Sinks Overview
---

Sinks are destinations where generated data is loaded. Think of a sink as the datastore or destination you want to populate with synthetic data.

- What is a sink? A target datastore where datagen writes output
- Examples of possible sinks: relational databases, data warehouses, message queues
- Current support: MySQL sinks

You reference sinks in your configuration file (config.json) to control where each model's data should be loaded.
