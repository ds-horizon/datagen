title: Single Field Model
description: Creating a simple model with one field
---


This example demonstrates the simplest possible datagen model: a single field with a static value.

:::note
This is the most basic datagen model structure. In real-world scenarios, you would typically use dynamic generation functions instead of static values.

### Model

Create a file named `users.dg`:

```go title="users.dg"
model users {
    fields {
        name() string
    }

    gens {
        func name() {
            return "John Doe"
        }
    }
}
```

### How to Run

```shell
$ datagenc gen . -f csv -n 3
```

### Output
```shell
$ cat users.csv
```
```csv
name
John Doe
John Doe
John Doe
```
